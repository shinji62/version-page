# Metadata

Metadata is written in YAML and JSON format during `in`, and can be provided to
`out` via a YAML or JSON file.

The contents of this metadata (in YAML format) are as follows:

```yaml

## Release

The top-level `release` key is required.

* `version`: *Required.* Version of the new release.

  Note, if sorting by semantic version in the `source` config
  (i.e. `sort_by: semver`) then this version must be a valid semantic version.

  Also, if `product_version` is a regex in the `source` config
  then this version must conform to that regex.

  These constraints prevent inconsistencies that would occur when creating a new
  version of a resource that cannot be discovered by the check for that resource.

* `id`: *Optional.* Written during `in` and ignored during `out`.

* `release_type`: *Required.* See the
[official docs](https://network.pivotal.io/docs/api) for the supported types.

  Note, if filtering by `release_type` in the `source` config
  then this release type must be the same.

  This is to prevent inconsistencies that would occur when creating a new
  version of a resource that cannot be discovered by the check for that resource.

* `eula_slug`: *Required.* The EULA slug e.g. `pivotal_software_eula`.

  See the
  [official docs](https://network.pivotal.io/docs/api#public/docs/api/v2/eulas.md)
  for the supported values.

* `release_date`: *Optional.*
  Release date in the form of: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

  If it is not present, the release date will be set to the current date.

* `description`: *Optional.* Free-form description text.
  e.g.
  ```
  The description for this release.

  May contain line breaks.
  ```

* `release_notes_url`: *Optional.* The release notes URL
  e.g. `http://url.to/release/notes`.

* `availability`: *Optional.* Supported values are:
  - `Admins Only`
  - `All Users`
  - `Selected User Groups Only`

* `product_files`: *Optional.* Written during `in` and ignored during `out`.

* `user_group_ids`: *Optional.* Comma-separated list of user
  group IDs.

  Each user group in the list will be added to the release.
  Will be used only if the availability is set to `Selected User Groups Only`.

* `controlled`: *Optional.* Boolean, defaults to `false`.

* `eccn`: *Optional.* String.

* `license_exception:`: *Optional.* String.

* `end_of_support_date`: *Optional.* Date in the form of: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

* `end_of_guidance_date`: *Optional.* Date in the form of: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

* `end_of_availability_date`: *Optional.* Date in the form of: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Product files

The top-level `product_files` key is optional.
If provided, it is permitted to be an empty array.

Each element in `product_files` must have a non-empty value for the `file` key.
All other keys are optional. The purpose of the keys is as follows:

* `file` *Required.* Relative path to file. Must match exactly one file
  located via the out param `file_glob`, or the resource will exit with error.

* `description` *Optional.* The file description
  (also known as _File Notes_ in Pivotal Network).

* `upload_as` *Optional.* The display name for the file in Pivotal Network.
  This affects only the display name; the filename of the uploaded file remains
  the same as that of the local file.

## File Groups

The top-level `file_groups` key is written to during `in` but is not read from
during `out`. Therefore it cannot be used to set file groups when creating
or updating a release.

## Dependencies

**Configuring dependencies directly is deprecated - use dependency specifiers instead**

The top-level `dependencies` key is optional.
If provided, it is permitted to be an empty array.

Each element in `dependencies` must have a non-empty value for the `release` key.
Within each `release` element either:

* `id` must be present and non-zero

or:

* `version` and `product.slug` must be present and non-empty.

## Dependency Specifiers

The top-level `dependency_specifiers` key is optional.
If provided, it is permitted to be an empty array.

Each element in `dependency_specifiers` must have a non-empty value for both
the `specifier` key and the `product_slug` key.

## Upgrade paths

The top-level `upgrade_paths` key is optional.
If provided, it is permitted to be an empty array.

Each element in `upgrade_paths` must have either:

* `id` - must be present and non-zero

or:

* `version` - must be present and non-empty.
  - Regular expressions are permitted - all matching
    upgrade paths will be added.
  - If an upgrade path matches multiple regular expressions,
    it will only be added once.
